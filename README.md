# VineyardVocations
Flagship metaverse representing a vineyard simulator that enables players to build towards whitelabeling their own cuvée to earn royalties from bottles sold in our champagne house.


Brief background information about the game:

Essentially people use the Character, Vineyard, and Vocation NFTs to create Commodity and Product NFTs that can be merged/crafted in-game to make actual blends of digital champagne — at the end of the year, people pay a $VIGNE fee and submit their final Champagne Product NFT so our champagne house can make a barrel for tasting at the end of the year, of which founders will taste and choose their favorite blend alongside a board of vintologist.

The person that crafts the winning blend for that year will have their blend added to our champagne house and receive royalties from each bottle sold without having to lift a finger. Additionally, their name will be added to future Character NFT cards as a new “Family/House” (if desired)! We are currently the only project working towards building a Metaverse enabling users to work towards real-world whitelabeled products that reward royalties through sales. 


Brief background information about the Character NFT Rarity:

People will receive the actual card as a phygital keepsake when they obtain their champagne bottle delivery. Each brand has a limited amount of each character. If the player collects enough NFTs from the same family/house, their avatar gets a bonus on xp gained in Vineyard Vocations, same thing with the Currency Faction — higher rarity characters reward more xp to the players as actions are completed.
